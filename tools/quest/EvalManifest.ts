//
//   npx tsx tools/quest/EvalManifest.ts quest_ahoy_run.ts [...]   -> JSON on stdout
//
// For the 23 sims whose steps are partly built by a function (`...southIn()`), which the AST
// reader in ExportHelper cannot evaluate and correctly refuses rather than half-export.
//
// HOW. The sim is copied into a scratch directory beside the three stub modules in evalstub/,
// which take the place of './harness.js', './questrun.js' and './a1lib.js' because those imports
// are RELATIVE: a copy of the file in another directory resolves them to whatever is next to it.
// Everything else it imports is '#/...' and resolves through the package's own imports map to the
// real engine modules, which is what the generators need and costs nothing to load.
//
// The file then runs top to bottom as written. `await H.boot()` returns at once instead of
// starting a world, the consts and generators evaluate for real, and `play(m)` keeps the manifest
// rather than playing the quest.
//
// WHY NOT EXTEND THE PARSER. Because the parser would have to become a TypeScript interpreter -
// loops, conditionals, helpers calling helpers - and would be wrong in a new way for every
// generator somebody writes next. Running the code is the only reading of it that cannot disagree
// with the sim.
