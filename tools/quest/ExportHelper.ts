// THE QUEST HELPER'S STEP TABLE, read out of the sim manifests that already prove it.
//
//   npx tsx tools/quest/ExportHelper.ts [out.json]
//
// WHY THE MANIFESTS AND NOT A NEW FILE. tools/sim/quest_*_run.ts already holds, for 108 quests,
// the ordered steps a player takes: who to talk to, which loc to click and where it is, what to be
// carrying, and - in `stage:` markers - the value of the quest's own varp after each leg. That is
// a quest helper's data exactly, and the nightly job RUNS it: a wrong coordinate or a renamed npc
// fails a sim. A hand-written helper script would be a second copy of the same knowledge with
// nothing checking it, which is how RuneLite's helpers drift from the game.
//
// READ WITH THE TYPESCRIPT AST, not by importing. Each manifest is a `const m: Manifest` inside a
// script whose first statement is `await H.boot()`, so importing one boots a world for forty
// seconds and the object is not exported anyway. The literals are static data - strings, numbers,
// arrays, nested objects - so the compiler's own parser reads them with no engine in the room, and
// nothing in tools/sim has to change to be exportable.
//
// WHAT IS DROPPED, and why the helper is not just the manifest re-emitted. A manifest is written
// for a robot that can teleport and set varps:
//
//   setpos   927 of them - a teleport to the start of a leg. A player walks; this becomes a
//            "travel to" marker rather than an instruction, because the manifest deliberately
//            does NOT record the route (the sims assert reachability separately).
//   stage    841 - the robot writing the quest's varp to skip ahead. These are the SEGMENT KEYS
//            here, not steps: everything between two of them is what you do at that stage.
//   rng      the dice pinned for a step. Meaningless to a player.
//   wait     a tick count for an animation.
//   level    a plane change the engine does; the loc click above it is the player's instruction.
//
// WHAT IS KEPT is talk/loc/held/worn/useNpc/useObj (the clicks), has/hasnt (the item list), go
// (a real walk the sim makes on foot), and the `note` lines, which carry the wiki's own step
// wording and are what the panel shows.

 * The reported case: The Feud sends you to pickpocket a villager, the sim happened to use
 * feud_villager_multi_2, and the marker pointed at that one across town while an identical
 * villager stood next to the player. Pollnivneach has three of them, Rat Catchers has six rats,
 * Sheep Herder four sick sheep.
 *
 * NOT A GUESS FROM THE NAMES, which would be wrong in both directions. The Feud binds opnpc3
 * (Pickpocket) on all three villagers, opnpc4 (Lure) on only the second and third, and opnpc5
 * (Knock-Out) on the third alone - so "any villager" is right for one step of that quest and
 * wrong for the next two. Asking which script the op resolves to gets each of them right, and
 * costs one walk of the npc table per op.
 *
 * ONLY A TYPE-SPECIFIC SCRIPT COUNTS. getByTrigger falls back to the category's script and then
 * to a global one, and a global fallback is shared by every npc that has no handler of its own -
 * grouping on that would make one family of half the cache. Passing -1 as the category leaves
 * only the type key and the global, and the global is what every id without a handler answers,
 * so an id whose answer IS the global has no script of its own and no family.
