// The quest helper's table, read the way a PLAYER reads it.
//
//   npx tsx tools/quest/WordingCheck.ts [quests.json]
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. Every row in data/quests.json is a sentence a person reads while standing in
// the game with the quest open, and the sentences are GENERATED - out of sim prose written for
// another developer, and out of debugnames out of the server's own source. Each rule below is a
// shape that reached the panel and read as a machine talking:
//
//   "Go to the walk back north out of the swamp."   a journey described as if it were a place
//   "Go to and the east room."                      a fragment joined to the step before it
//   "Use an item on Cauldron."                      true, and no use to someone at the cauldron
//   "Talk to agrith reen alkharid."                 a handle out of the content, lowercased
//   "plaguesheep 1."                                a step with no verb at all
//
// WHY A CHECK AND NOT A TEST OF THE EXPORTER. The exporter's rules are regular expressions over
// English, and the interesting input is not what I would think to write down - it is the 5,322
// rows that 106 sims actually produce. So this reads the shipped table and asserts the shapes
// that cannot be right, which is a test over the real corpus rather than over my memory of it.
// A rule that fires names the quest and the row, because the fix is nearly always in the sim's
// prose rather than here.
