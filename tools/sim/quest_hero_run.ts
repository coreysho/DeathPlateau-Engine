// HEROES' QUEST, played through on foot - as far as one player can take it.
//
// Quest 37 of the quest-by-quest pass. Achietties wants three things: an Entranan firebird's
// feather, a cooked lava eel, and a master thief's armband. The first two are solo work and this
// run does them in full. The third is not, and that is not a bug:
//
// Heroes' Quest in 2006 was a TWO-PLAYER quest, and this content implements it that way on
// purpose. [proc,grip_attack] refuses to let a Black Arm member lift a finger against Grip
// ("Perhaps you need another player's help...?"), and [oplocu,pete_treasuredoor] refuses Grip's
// keys from anybody who has not handed over the ID papers - which only the Black Arm member does.
// So the candlestick needs one player of each gang: the Black Arm deputy opens the side door and
// later the treasure room, the Phoenix member kills Grip, and the chest holds two candlesticks,
// "one for you, and one for the person who killed Grip for you". That heist is driven by
// tools/sim/heroes_candlestick.ts, which runs both players at once; this run takes the Black Arm
// side as far as the deputy's post and stops there.
