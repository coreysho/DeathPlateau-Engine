// MONK'S FRIEND, played through on foot.
//
// Quest 25 of the quest-by-quest pass. Brother Omad in the Ardougne monastery cannot sleep for the
// crying of Brother Androe's son, whose blanket was stolen by thieves; the thieves' cave is under a
// ring of stones in the forest, and its ladder only exists while the quest is live - a timer spawns
// it when the player comes within two tiles. Then Brother Cedric, drunk in the forest with a broken
// cart, a jug of water and some logs, and a party.
