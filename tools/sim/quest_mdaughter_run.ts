// MOUNTAIN DAUGHTER, played through on foot.
//
// Quest 67 of the quest-by-quest pass, and the one that needed rebuilding rather than fixing: what
// was here before had Svidi as Hamal's daughter, Asleif as his dead wife, three white pearls as the
// opening favour, the body dug out of the roots with a spade, the Kendal gated behind the burial and
// the half of the Ancient Rock set on the cairn. The cache says otherwise in its own words - the
// necklace is "Asleif, daughter of the mountain camp chieftain", the bubbles on the lake are a
// Shining pool you can hear singing in, the fruit's param is next_obj_stage,white_pearl_seed, and
// the safety guarantee "supposedly grants Svidi safe passage into Rellekka".
//
// So this walks the real one: in over the boulder, the pool's two errands done in either order,
// the man in the bear skin, and five rocks off the goat pen.
