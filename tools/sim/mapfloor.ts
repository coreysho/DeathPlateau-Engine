// IS ANYTHING DRAWN ON THIS TILE - the question collision cannot answer.
//
// A tile is drawn only if its mapsquare row gives it an overlay (o) or an underlay (u). Everything
// else is a hole: the client builds no Ground and no QuickGround for it, so a player standing there
// is standing in the air. The engine's collision map knows nothing about this - a hole at plane 3
// over a street is "open" as far as canTravel is concerned, which is why fifteen rooftop agility
// landings sat in one and passed every sim in this directory.
//
// THREE ANSWERS, not two, and the middle one is the trap:
//
//   drawn    the mapsquare draws a floor there
//   onLoc    nothing is drawn, but a loc occupies the tile - which is a floor, because half the
//            agility obstacles are things you climb ON TO: a market stall, a basket, a banner, a
//            steep roof, a pile of fish. The tile carries no overlay, is flagged LOC and blocked,
//            and the player put there by the obstacle is standing on its model. Pollnivneach is
//            nine obstacles of exactly this and a sweep without it condemns the whole course.
//   thinAir  neither. This is the fault.
//
// And BLOCKED IS NOT BROKEN either: Draynor's whole rooftop deck reads "o175 f1" - drawn, and
// flagged - because a grafted roof is not meant to be walked on; the course carries you across it.
