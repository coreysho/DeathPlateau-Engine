// THE GREAT BRAIN ROBBERY, played through on foot.
//
// A quest the 377 cache does not have a line of: November 2006 against a September 2006 cache, so
// Harmony Island, the Underwater Tunnel, Brother Tranquility, Mi-Gor, Barrelchest, the Sorebones and
// all fourteen items came out of the rev 474 cache. content/scripts/quests/quest_tgbr/configs/
// quest_tgbr.constant is the design document; this is the proof that the fourteen stages can be
// walked in order.
//
// WHAT THIS RUN CANNOT DO, said here rather than quietly skipped:
//   the ten wooden cats are carved at a Workbench in a player-owned house, and a sim player has no
//   house, so they are handed over instead. The carving itself (~tgbr_carve_cats, one plank and one
//   fur each at 16 Crafting for 15 experience) is checked by tools/sim/tgbrcats.ts.
//
