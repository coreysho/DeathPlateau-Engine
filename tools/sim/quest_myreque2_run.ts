// IN AID OF THE MYREQUE, played through on foot.

// Quest 53 of the quest-by-quest pass, and the biggest single thing in the build: 206 burgh_ locs,
// 65 burgh_ npcs and a town to put back together. Unlike In Search of the Myreque this one was
// written FROM the cache rather than from the varbit names, so its shape is the walkthrough's -
// Florin's chest, the cellar rubble, the store roof and wall, Aurel's crate, the bank booth, the
// furnace, the blood tithe, Ivan's walk to Paterdomus, the library, the tomb and the rod.
