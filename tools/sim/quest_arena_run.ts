// FIGHT ARENA, played through on foot.
//
// Quest 81 of the quest-by-quest pass. General Khazard has taken Lady Servil's husband and son to
// fight in his arena, and the way in is a guard's uniform out of a chest and a bottle of something
// the guard on the cells should not be drinking.
//
// The three fights and the cutscenes between them are driven by the content, not the manifest: the
// ogre's death chains into Justin, then Khazard, then the cells; the scorpion's into Bouncer. So
// each fight is followed by a `say` with nothing to pick, which is drive() clicking through what
// the quest says next.
