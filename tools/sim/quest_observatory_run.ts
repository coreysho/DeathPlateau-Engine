// OBSERVATORY QUEST, played through on foot.
//
// Quest 72 of the quest-by-quest pass. Goblins have wrecked the professor's telescope; you bring
// him wood, bronze and glass, then fetch the lens mould the goblins hid in their kitchen - which
// means a key out of a chest in the cavern and a guard on the kitchen gate.
