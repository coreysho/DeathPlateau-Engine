// THRONE OF MISCELLANIA, played through on foot.
//
// Quest 105 of the quest-by-quest pass. miscellania.ts already drives the whole quest - 57 checks
// over Vargas, Sigrid, the anthem, the treaty, the pen, all three courting rounds and the regency -
// but it teleports between every one of them, and the castle is the most door-bound building in the
// pass: SIX clicks from the courtyard to King Vargas, and eight to Princess Astrid.
//
// tools/sim/walkgraph.ts (written for this quest, out of templewalk.ts) is what found those routes.
// It also found something a teleporting sim cannot: of the thirty-six herb patches outside the
// castle, TWENTY-NINE cannot be reached. They are placed as shape-11 centrepieces in a seven-by-
// eight block and the ring of them walls off the forty-seven tiles in the middle, so the wiki's
// main free favour source - "rake herbs and flax outside the palace walls" - is four fifths
// unreachable. That is the 377 cache's own placement, not this server's, so it is recorded rather
// than changed.
//
// WHAT IS DELEGATED: the two courting emotes, because an emote pushed through the harness does
// not hold the protected lock [label,emote]'s p_finduid wants and so never reaches
// misc_emote_react - miscellania.ts drives both for real. And the last of the favour arithmetic. Approval starts at 32 (25%) when the treaty
// is signed and the regency wants 96 (75%), and the walk demonstrates every source it can reach -
// seven weeds and a maple - before setting the remainder. Repeating one click sixty-four times is
// not what a walk is for, and miscellania.ts drives the per-source arithmetic already.
