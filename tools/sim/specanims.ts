// EVERY SPECIAL PLAYS ITS OWN ANIMATION, not the weapon's ordinary swing.
// Usage: npx tsx tools/sim/specanims.ts   (exit code is the verdict)
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. The dragon warhammer's Smash played human_blunt_pound - the animation the
// hammer uses for a NORMAL attack - with the granite maul's graphic over it. Nothing errored,
// rs2check was clean, the damage and the Defence drain were both right, and every sim passed:
// the only symptom was that the special looked like a normal hit, which no assertion in this
// directory was looking at. The owner spotted it in game.
//
// So this fires each special and asserts two things no other sim does:
//
//   * the animation played is the special's own, and
//   * it is NOT the animation that weapon swings with ordinarily.
//
// The second half is the one that matters. A special that plays the right-NAMED animation is easy
// to assert; a special that plays the weapon's own attack animation is what actually shipped, and
// only a comparison against the ordinary swing catches it.
//
// The 2006 specials are checked too. That was once an argument for leaving them alone, and it only
// holds where the weapon's own animation is what it is playing: the bone dagger was playing the
// DRAGON DAGGER's, which is not a period choice, it is the wrong weapon's.

// WHERE THE GRAPHIC GOES. The beta-world dump (rune-server 697435) spells this out and I read it
// wrong twice. It writes "gfx: N" for a graphic on the PLAYER and says "enemy entity gfx: N" when
// it means the target - and of these four only the bludgeon says enemy entity:
//
//     dragon warhammer   anim 1378  gfx 1292               -> player
//     granite hammer     anim 1378  gfx 1450               -> player
//     dragon sword       anim 7515  gfx 1369               -> player
//     abyssal bludgeon   anim 3299  enemy entity gfx 1284   -> target
//
// First it was spotanim_pl at height 96 for all four - right entity for three, wrong height for
// all. Then it was spotanim_npc at 0 for all four - right height, wrong entity for three. The
// build demonstrated the rule the whole time: pvm_godswords.rs2 puts each godsword's own graphic
// on the player and only the Zamorakian's freeze on the target, which is exactly what the dump's
// "zgs ... gfx: 1210 enemy entity gfx: 369" says.
//
// Height 0 is right for all of them, measured rather than assumed: every one of these models runs
// from y=0 down to y=-4500..-9700, so it stands on the ground and extends upward, the same shape
// as spot_ags_spec which this build has always drawn at 0.
//

// below are checked inside the same loop that fires each special rather than afterwards.
// weapon, its spec label, the animation the special should play, the graphic it should throw, and
// the params holding the weapon's ORDINARY attack animations - the thing it must not play.
// `where` is the entity the graphic belongs on: 'npc' for an impact effect at the point of the
