// A QUEST PLAYED THROUGH ON FOOT, rather than simulated.
//
// Every other sim in this directory teleports. a1lib's talk() tries ten tiles around the npc until
// one of them lets the op through, which is fine for testing a dialogue and useless for testing a
// QUEST: a player who is already standing next to Glough's cage never finds out that it is sealed on
// all four sides, and a player who blinks into Zanaris never finds out that the gate has no handler.
// Both of those were real bugs, both were reported by the owner, and no sim in this directory could
// have found either one.
//
// So this runner has no teleport in it. A step either walks, or it fails and says where it stopped.
//
//   go      travel on foot. A BFS over the engine's own canTravel finds the route and the player is
//           fed one waypoint per tick, which is what a client does. No route = the step fails.
//   talk    opnpc from wherever the player is standing, and let the ENGINE route the last stretch
//           with its real pathfinder - which will not open a door or climb a ladder. If the player
//           never gets there the step fails, and that is the finding rather than an inconvenience.
//   loc     the same for a loc click, with the route a client would send.
//   give    an item the player would have bought or banked. Declared, never assumed: the list of
//           gives IS the quest's item requirement, and the run prints it at the end.
//   stage   assert the quest's own progress variable. A step that does not move it is a step that
//           did nothing, however much dialogue it produced.
//
// Assertions that fail are recorded and the run carries on, so one pass gives the whole picture.
// Anything that leaves the player unable to continue stops the run and names the step.

//
//   activeScript      a suspended script means a dialogue opened - but a door, a ladder or a chest

//                     ladder the player never reached read as a successful climb, and the next step
//                     then failed on the wrong floor - blaming the chest for the ladder's mistake.
//   any script ran     the player's interfaces are redrawn periodically by scripts of their own
//                     ("Total XP", "Players online"), so this passed a crone the player never
//                     walked to. It was the worst of the three: a silent false pass.

    // 2624,3366", on the sheep that was standing against that fence.
