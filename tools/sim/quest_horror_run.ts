// HORROR FROM THE DEEP, played through on foot.
//
// Quest 93 of the quest-by-quest pass. tools/sim/horror2.ts already drives the pieces of this quest
// as set pieces - the two lighthouses, the lighting puzzle, the strange wall, the Mother's colour
// cycle - but nothing had ever walked it, and a walk is the only thing that answers "can a player
// get from Larrissa to the god book without being teleported".
//
// Two things about it are unlike every other quest in the pass:
//
//   The lighthouse is two buildings. m39_56 is the real one; m38_71 is a byte-identical copy with
//   the furniture smashed, the light out and Larrissa inside, and the player is in the copy from the
//   first time through the front door until the Dagannoth Mother is dead. So the walk's coordinates
//   jump 64 west and 960 north the moment the door opens, and come back when she dies. That is not a
//   teleport the walk is doing - ~horror_lighthouse_coord does it, which is the thing being tested.
//
//   The Mother cannot be fought by swinging at her. She changes colour every 30 ticks and only
//   damage of the matching type touches her, so a melee kill is seven attacks per orange phase and
//   nothing at all for the other 150 ticks. The fight step takes all six of her forms as its type
//   list (npc_changetype_keepall means she is a different npc_type in each one) and is judged on
//   %horror reaching completion rather than on a corpse.
