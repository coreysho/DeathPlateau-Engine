// DOES A DEAD NPC GO AWAY? Asked of the npcs a fuzz run reported as corpses, against a control group
// that works, in three different situations - because the finding counts alone cannot say whether
// those npcs are broken or the watcher's threshold is wrong.
//
//   npx tsx tools/sim/corpses.ts
//
// A 99-bot run reported four corpses - "still in the world N ticks after its hitpoints reached 0
// (npc_del never ran)" - for mm_monkey_guard, mm_oipuis and mm_duke, at 12 and 16 ticks against
// CORPSE_TICKS = 10.
//
// WHAT THIS SETTLES. An ordinary monster leaves the world THREE TICKS after its hitpoints reach 0,
// which is what [proc,npc_death] in skill_combat/scripts/npc/npc_death.rs2 should cost:
// npc_arrivedelay for up to two ticks, then npc_anim, npc_delay(1), npc_del. So CORPSE_TICKS = 10
// is three times the norm, the watcher is not crying wolf, and 12 and 16 ticks are real anomalies.
// It also exonerates two of the three suspects: mm_duke and mm_monkey_guard both go in three ticks.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT SETTLE: the cause. Three hypotheses, each the obvious one in turn, each dead:
//
//   the npc_findhero chain aborts and takes npc_del with it - which is what the corpse watcher's
//     own docstring blames for the one live instance it was written for. Ruled out by reading: all
//     six hooks after the arrivedelay return from THEMSELVES on a failed npc_findhero, not from
//     npc_death, so a bot that relocated mid-kill does not stop the removal.
//   npc_arrivedelay waits out a chase route - the one thing a 99-bot world does that a probe does
//     not, since the bots never stop moving. Ruled out by measurement: killed mid-chase costs at
//     most ONE extra tick (man 4, goblin and rat still 3).
//   several attackers at once, so %npc_aggressive_player is not whoever landed the kill - also
//     something one player cannot produce. Ruled out: a crowd of four changes nothing, and it is
//     what finally let mm_monkey_guard be killed at all.
//
// So the corpse needs something else the fuzz world has and this does not. The untried candidates,
// in the order they are worth trying: a SPELL kill, which is the bots' single commonest action
// (61,617 casts in that run, more than any other); an attacker who dies or logs out between the
// hit and the removal; and an instanced area.
//
// mm_oipuis is still untestable here - it cannot be brought to 0 hitpoints even by four max-stat
// players with dragon scimitars - so this probe says nothing at all about it, and the denominator
// is printed for that reason. A probe that skips its subject and exits 0 is the trap
// quest_garden_run fell into, aborting at step 6 and reporting 4 of 5 passing while 83 checks had
// never run.
//
// FOUR WRONG TURNS GOT HERE, all of them the probe's own and all worth leaving written down:
//
//   1. mm_duke died in three ticks on one run and was UNTESTED on the next with nothing changed.
//      That was an attack roll landing once, and it was briefly reported as a finding. A single
//      sample is not a measurement.
//   2. Re-setting hitpoints to 1 every tick, to make the kill certain, stopped EVERYTHING dying -
//      including the npc that had died before. Reverted.
//   3. The suspects were never unkillable: the controls have trivial defence and die to an unarmed
//      player at once, while all three carry 130 defence and the probe's player held nothing. It
//      wields a dragon scimitar now, and a crowd of four got the last one down.
//   4. A kill the probe never observed at 0 hitpoints was reported as "0 ticks, the same as alone".
//      That read as a measurement of instant removal; it means only that the death and the removal
//      both fell between two of the loop's looks. It says "no interval to report" now.
