// TEMPLE OF IKOV, played through on foot, siding with the Guardians of Armadyl.
//
// WORK IN PROGRESS - 52 of 53 checks, as far as the Fire Warrior of Lesarkus arriving. Everything
// before him is proven: Lucien's interview, the temple ladder, the dark stairs, the web, the boots
// and the swap that makes them weigh less than nothing, the pendant, the gate of fear, the lava gap,
// the double door at the end of the far ledge, the lever off the floor, the bracket (a shape-7 wall
// fitting - east or north of it, never west), the mended lever, the south gate, an ice arrow out of
// the right chest (forceapproach 14 leaves only its south side), both gates again, the trapped
// lever searched and pulled, and the door it unbolts.
//
// It stops on the very last blow: 85 of 86. Everything else walks - the interview, the ladder, the
// dark stairs, the web, the boots and the swap, the pendant, the gate of fear, the lava gap, the far
// ledge's door, the lever, the bracket, the mended lever, the south gate, TWENTY ice arrows out of
// the one loaded chest (one is not a fight - that was why the Fire Warrior could not be hurt), both
// gates again, the trapped lever, the Fire Warrior dead in 77 ticks, Winelda's twenty limpwurt
// roots, and the Guardians' pendant.
//
// Two things the run found on the way:
//   - the Guardians really do refuse to talk to a player wearing Lucien's pendant, which is the
//     wiki's warning and is implemented. There is no harness call for unequipping, so the pendant
//     comes off the way the engine takes it off: wear something else in the same slot.
//   - Lucien dies FOUR times at the end and %ikov stays at 70. [ai_queue3,ikov_lucien2] only queues
//     the completion when `npc_findhero = true & %ikov = ^ikov_helping_armadyl`; the stage is 70, so
//     npc_findhero is coming back false and he falls through to an ordinary death instead. Whether
//     that is the damage tracking, ~lucien_attack's map_members check in a free-to-play Edgeville,
//     or the harness, is the one thing left on this quest.
