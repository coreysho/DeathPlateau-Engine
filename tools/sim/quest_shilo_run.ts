// SHILO VILLAGE, played through on foot.
//
// Quest 97 of the quest-by-quest pass, and the third in a row with no sim of any kind behind it:
// 2,198 lines across six scripts, two underground map squares for Ah Za Rhoon, a tomb on Cairn
// Isle, a second tomb under the jungle, and a boss with three forms.
//
// The quest's own varp is %zombiequeen, not anything with "shilo" in it, which is why it is easy to
// miss when looking for coverage.
