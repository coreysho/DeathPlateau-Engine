// MONKEY MADNESS, played through on foot. Nothing here teleports except the quest's own transport -
// Daero's blindfolded walk down to the hangar, Waydar's glider, Lumdo's boat and Kruk - which is the
// quest working rather than the runner cheating.
//
// Each `note` says which step of the real quest the stretch below it stands in for. Where the real
// quest has a step and this server does not, the note says so and there are no steps under it: the
// Karamja shipyard leg, the hangar's sliding puzzle and the whole jail sequence are all missing, and
// a run cannot walk through what was never built.
//
// The player is maxed before the run. Monkey Madness has no skill requirements - it gates on combat
// ability - and the tunnel to Zooknock is full of level 98 monkey zombies and level 142 skeletons,
// so an unarmed level 3 would be measuring how fast it dies rather than whether the quest works.
