// BIG CHOMPY BIRD HUNTING, played through on foot.
//
// Quest 94 of the quest-by-quest pass, and the first one in it with no sim of any kind behind it.
//
// Almost everything in this quest is a dice roll, which is why it needs the `rng` step more than
// anything walked so far:
//
//   the ogre chest    random(3) = 0 fails to lift the rock and drains a Strength level - one
//                     attempt in three, and it is the = 0 branch that FAILS, not the one that works
//   the arrow shafts  ~random_range(2, 6) shafts per achey log, and tips per wolf bone
//   the bait          the bloated toad rolls random(5) = 1 every 25 ticks to call a chompy, and
//                     bursts on its fourth roll whether one came or not
//   Rantz's shot      [ai_timer,rantz] runs every tick and returns unless random(20) = 0
//
// Those pins pull against each other - the toad's 1 in 5 wants a return in [0.2, 0.4), the chest
// wants one at or above a third, and Rantz's 1 in 20 wants one under 0.05 - so the walk runs on
// 0.35, which satisfies the first two at once, drops to 0 to make Rantz shoot, and puts the
// real generator back before the player takes the bow, because a pinned roll makes every hit roll
// identical.
//
// The Chompy Bird's Attack is op5, not op2: [apnpc5,chompy_bird], with its own combat proc that
// refuses anything but an ogre bow with ogre arrows in the quiver. The fight step gained an `op`
// for it.
