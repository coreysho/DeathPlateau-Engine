// RUNE MYSTERIES, played through on foot.

// Quest 6 of the full quest-by-quest pass. Three towns, two long overland legs and one cellar: the
// Duke on the first floor of Lumbridge Castle, Sedridor under the Wizards' Tower, Aubury in his
// Varrock rune shop, and then back to Sedridor. The overland legs are declared with setpos - they
// are road, not quest - but every door, staircase and ladder between the street and the npc is
// clicked, because "talk to the Duke upstairs" is four doors and a staircase and any one of them
// could be the thing that is broken.
