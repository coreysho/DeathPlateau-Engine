// HOLY GRAIL, played through on foot.

// Quest 51 of the quest-by-quest pass. The Grail has passed into Gielinor, none of Arthur's
// knights came back with it last time, and the way in is a whistle off a table in Draynor Manor
// blown under a tower on the Karamja peninsula. The thing on the bridge heals to full if the last
// blow is not Excalibur's.
