// maps/multiway.csv is a list of ZONES - 8x8 tiles - and GameMap.isMulti looks a tile up by the

//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT TELL YOU. Nothing in the 377 cache says which areas Old School treats as
// multi-way, so the audit half is checked against a written-down list. The npc and square halves
// are derived from the built map and cannot be got wrong; the list cannot be got RIGHT by any
// means available here, which is why it carries its sources in comments and why an area nobody
// has written down is not checked at all.
//
// WHY ZONES WITH NO GROUND ARE SKIPPED. The first version of this audit compared hand-drawn
// rectangles against the csv and reported God Wars as 247/256 - nine zones short. All nine are
// void: m44_82's south-west corner and the strips where the four squares meet have no level-0
// tiles at all, and the csv is right not to list them. A rectangle over a dungeon is always
// bigger than the dungeon, so the question has to be "every zone with ground on it", not "every
// zone in the box" - otherwise the audit reports a gap that cannot be closed and the real gaps
// hide behind it.
