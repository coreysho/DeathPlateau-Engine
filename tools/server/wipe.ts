/**
 * The launch wipe: every player starts again, and keeps nothing but their name, their password and
 * what they voted for.
 *
 *   npx tsx tools/server/wipe.ts                 what it WOULD do, and nothing else
 *   npx tsx tools/server/wipe.ts --confirm       do it
 *   npx tsx tools/server/wipe.ts --profile main  which world (default: NODE_PROFILE)
 *
 * WHAT SURVIVES, and why each one:
 *
 *   account              the username and the password hash. Players log in with what they
 *                        already have; nobody re-registers, nobody is locked out.
 *   saved logins         account_token, which is what the client keeps instead of the password -
 *                        one row per account per computer. The account survives a wipe, so the
 *                        saved login has to survive with it: clearing the table would make
 *                        everybody whose launcher remembers them type their password again on
 *                        launch day, for no gain. A token expires on its own after a month unused,
 *                        and can be cancelled per account without this.
 *   staff                any account with staffmodlevel > 0 is not touched at all - not its save,
 *                        not its hiscores, not its collection log. Staff keep their characters.
 *   the vote ledger      untouched, so cooldowns and uncollected tickets carry over...
 *   vote points/tickets  ...AND what a player had already collected is counted BEFORE the save is
 *                        taken away and credited back to the ledger, because both live in the
 *                        character: %vote_points is a varp and a ticket is an item. Wiping the
 *                        save without this would delete exactly the thing a voter was promised
 *                        they could keep. One ticket is one point (^vote_points_per_ticket), so
 *                        they add together and come back as tickets, to collect from the clerk.
 *   bans and mutes       ipban and the account's own ban/mute columns. A wipe is not an amnesty.
 *   moderation records   report, input_report, public_chat, private_chat. These are what happened;
 *                        they are not a character and a wipe is no reason to lose them.
 *   session history      session and its three child tables. The same argument, plus a practical
 *                        one: session_log, session_wealth and session_input key off session_uuid
 *                        and deleting the parent would orphan all three. The activity page's
 *                        history is built from these, and a server that has been up for months
 *                        should not pretend on launch day that it has not.
 *
 * WHAT GOES, for every non-staff account:
 *
 *   the save file        data/players/<profile>/<name>.sav - levels, items, bank, quests, varps,
 *                        position, appearance. MOVED, not deleted: see below.
 *   hiscore              both tables, AND FOR STAFF TOO - the one thing staff do not keep. They
 *                        are derived from the save, so leaving them would show a maxed board full
 *                        of characters that no longer exist; and a staff row would be pre-launch
 *                        progress ranked against players who start at nothing.
 *   collection_log       the same.
 *   friendlist           a fresh account has no friends list. (ignorelist goes with it.)
 *   the trading post     every listing and every offer on the board, and the collection box of
 *                        anybody whose character is going. THE POST IS A SEPARATE DATABASE -
 *                        data/tradingpost/<profile>.sqlite, not db.sqlite and not the save - and
 *                        everything in it is keyed on a USERNAME, which is the one thing a wipe
 *                        deliberately keeps. Left alone it hands a player his pre-wipe items back
 *                        across the wipe: an open listing is holding the item he put up, a pending
 *                        offer is holding the coins he bid, and the collection box is holding
 *                        whatever he has not picked up yet. None of that is in the save file, so
 *                        moving the save does not touch any of it.
 *                        Staff keep their characters, so what the post is holding FOR STAFF comes
 *                        back to their collection box rather than being destroyed - the board ends
 *                        up empty either way, and that is the part players see.
 *   clan chats           data/clans/<profile>.sqlite, which is a third database and username-keyed
 *                        like the post. A wiped player's channel goes with his character, along
 *                        with the record of which channel he was last in and the note saying he
 *                        has already been put in Help once - that last one matters, because
 *                        keeping it would leave his brand-new character the only new character on
 *                        the world that is NOT put in the Help channel at login.
 *                        TWO KINDS OF CHANNEL SURVIVE. Staff own theirs and keep their characters.
 *                        And the Help channel is owned by 'help', which is not a player at all:
 *                        its name and settings are made in game and meant to outlive a restart, so
 *                        a wipe that deleted it would quietly undo them.
 *                        A channel's member list is not stored as a membership - it is a copy of
 *                        the OWNER'S friends list, refreshed from the friend server when he logs
 *                        in. Staff keep their friends list, so there is nothing here to prune: a
 *                        wiped player stops being in a staff clan when he stops being in that
 *                        staff member's friends, which is a decision for the staff member.
 *
 * NOTHING IS DELETED, it is moved. The saves go to data/players/<profile>/wiped-<timestamp>/,
 * db.sqlite is copied to db.sqlite.bak-<timestamp>, and the trading post to
 * <its file>.bak-<timestamp>, before a single row is touched. A wipe is the
 * one irreversible thing a server does, and it is done once, at the worst possible moment to
 * discover a mistake.
 *
 * IT REFUSES WHILE ANYBODY IS LOGGED IN. The server holds a character in memory and writes the
 * file at logout, so a save taken away underneath a live player comes straight back. Stop the
 * world first.
