// "dev (destructive commands) - AT LEAST 4"), so on an OPEN development world the rank checks in
// ClientCheatHandler mean nothing, and the commands that reach other players or the whole world -
// teleto, teleother, giveother, setvarother, broadcast, reboot, ban, mute, kick - would belong to
// anyone who connected. Being production-only was standing in for that.
//
// A STAFF-ONLY WORLD IS NOT AN OPEN ONE. NODE_MIN_STAFF_LEVEL refuses anybody below it at login
// (LoginThread.belowStaffLevel) before the promotion ever happens, so everyone on the dev world was
// already staff, and a moderator there should have the moderator commands they have on live.
//
// Lives here rather than in the handler because ::commands has to answer for the same rule: a
// command the handler silently does not have must be a command ::commands does not list.
