// THE PUBLIC MARKET FEED (custom, 2026-11-09). When somebody lists an item, a card for it goes to a
// Discord channel.
//
// This is the other half of server/discord/DiscordThread.ts, which has always been private: that
// one DMs a SELLER their own notices and lets them accept an offer from their phone. Nothing told
// anybody else that a thing was for sale, so the market only worked for people already standing at
// it.
//
// A WEBHOOK, NOT THE BOT. The bot is a gateway connection with a link table and a confirmation
// flow, and it is in a worker for good reasons; posting a picture to one channel needs none of
// that. A webhook URL is one HTTP POST, works whether or not the bot is configured, and if Discord
// is down the game does not notice. The URL IS A SECRET - anyone holding it can post to the channel
// as the server - so it lives in .env, is never printed, and never appears in a commit.
//
// NOTHING HERE RUNS ON THE TICK except the first line of post(). The card is drawn and the request
// is sent on the timer below, off the back of the queue, and every failure is swallowed: a market
// that stops working because Discord rate-limited us would be a bad trade.
//
// THE THROTTLE IS THE POINT OF THE QUEUE. A feed that posts every listing the instant it is made is
// a feed people mute, and on a busy evening it would be hundreds. One card every MARKET_FEED_EVERY
// milliseconds, and a listing worth less than MARKET_FEED_MIN never goes at all. When more arrive
// than the timer can send, the CHEAPEST waiting card is dropped rather than the newest - a backlog
// should lose the bronze daggers, not the whale.

/**
 * One card to one webhook. The only place the multipart is built, so the preview tool and the live
 * feed cannot disagree about what Discord is sent - which matters, because the tool is what gets
 * used to prove a new webhook works and a tool that posts a DIFFERENT shape proves nothing.
 *
 * The URL is never logged by anything that calls this.
