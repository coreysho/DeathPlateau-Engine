// CLAN CHAT (custom, 2026-09-23). The 2008 channel: a player sets up a channel under their own name,
// others join it by typing that name, and anything said with "/" in front goes to everyone in it.
//
// A CHANNEL BELONGS TO ITS OWNER'S NAME and exists once the owner has given it a name in Clan Setup
// (clan_setname). It does not need its owner online - people talk in it while they are away - so the
// settings live here, not in anybody's save. Setting the name to "" closes it.
//
// RANKS are the numbers 2008 used, so the requirement settings compare with >=:
//   -1 anyone   0 the owner's friends   7 the owner   127 staff (staffModLevel 2 and up)
// Each of enter, talk and kick is one of -1, 0 or 7 ("Anyone", "Any friends", "Only me"). The 1-6
// ranks between (Recruit to General, given to individual friends) are left for later; the numbers are
// kept so they slot in without a data change.
//
// "ANY FRIENDS" NEEDS THE OWNER'S FRIEND LIST, which the engine does not hold - it lives with the
// friend server. The list the friend server sends at login is kept on the Player (friends37) and
// changed with every add and delete, and an owner's list is copied into their channel row so the
// check still works while they are offline.
//
// ONE WORLD. The members, and who is in what, are this process's. A second world would have
// channels of its own; putting clan chat through the friend server is what would join them.
//
// A KICK keeps the player out for an hour, as it did in 2008. That is held in memory - a restart
// forgives it.
