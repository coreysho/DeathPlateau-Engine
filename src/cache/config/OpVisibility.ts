// custom (2026-11-02) - "is this right-click option hidden?", in ONE place.
//
// FOUND BY tools/sim/opsweep.ts. The content writes this marker both ways - 674 `hidden` and 103
// `Hidden` across the configs - and the two sides of the connection disagreed about which counted:
//
//   client   jagex2/config/LocType.java and friends: equalsIgnoreCase("hidden"), so the client
//            drops BOTH spellings and never draws either option.
//   server   OpLocHandler, OpNpcHandler and OpObjHandler compared === 'hidden', case-sensitive, so
//            for the 103 capitalised ones the server's "bad client: that option is hidden" check
//            did not fire. The option a real client will not even draw was accepted if sent.
//
// Nothing a normal player does reaches it, because a normal client never offers the click. A client
// that sends the packet anyway got the interaction - or, where no trigger claimed it, defaultOp.
// Matching the client is the fix, and having one function to match it in is what stops the two
// drifting apart again.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// custom (2026-11-03) - "could a client ever send this op?", with multilocs resolved the way the
// handler resolves them.
//
// A multiloc is one loc on the map whose TYPE depends on a varbit or varp: a bank booth that is
// rubble before a quest and a booth after, a tree that becomes a stump. OpLocHandler does this, and
// this file mirrors it rather than approximating it:
//
//     let locType = LocType.get(loc.type);                 // the type PLACED on the map
//     if (locType.multivarp !== -1)   -> multiloc[player's varp]
//     else if (locType.multivarbit !== -1) -> multiloc[player's varbit]
//     if (!locType.op || isHiddenOp(locType.op[op - 1]))  -> "bad client", refused
//
// So the resolution is DOWNWARD ONLY: the placed type, or one of the variants its own multiloc list
// can select. It does not go up from a variant to its shell and it does not go sideways between
// siblings. Getting that wrong in both directions is how this ended up in one file: a shell-only
// check called 60 working sim steps broken, and a check that walked shells and siblings cleared
// Desert Treasure's obelisks, which a real OpLoc packet is refused for.
//
// A state out of range leaves locType as the shell, so the shell's own ops count too.
//
// `hidden` counts as DECLARED here. The handler refuses it for a client - and so does this - but
// p_oploc re-enters a hidden op from script and the content relies on that, which is why
// tools/sim/orphans.ts asks this question with hidden allowed and opsweep asks it with hidden
// refused. The two are different questions about the same field; see those files' headers.
